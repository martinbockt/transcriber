## Original Transcript

Let me create a task list for this week. First, we need to complete the export functionality - that's done. Then add unit tests for the export module - also done. We still need to review pull request 123 by tomorrow. There are some responsive design issues on mobile that need fixing. Documentation needs to be updated with the new export feature by Tuesday. And finally, someone needs to prepare the demo presentation for stakeholders.
